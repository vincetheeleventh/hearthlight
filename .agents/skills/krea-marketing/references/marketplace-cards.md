# Marketplace Cards

Use this reference when the user asks for marketplace listing images, secondary product images, product cards, infographics, lifestyle listing shots, or A+ style content modules.

## Scopes

| Scope | Creates |
|---|---|
| `main` | One compliant lead marketplace image |
| `product_images` | Main image plus secondary product/detail/lifestyle images |
| `aplus` | Main image plus A+ style product-detail modules |
| `full_set` | Main image, secondary images, and A+ modules |

## Assets

Use these asset labels when planning a custom subset:

- `main_image`
- `infographic`
- `multi_angle`
- `detail_shot`
- `lifestyle`
- `whats_in_box`
- `aplus_hero_banner`
- `aplus_pain_points`
- `aplus_features`
- `aplus_ingredients`
- `aplus_efficacy`
- `aplus_how_to_use`
- `aplus_endorsement`

## Workflow

1. Ask for product image/URL, marketplace/category, scope, brand context, and required claims.
2. Prefer real product references. If the source is a URL/PDP, fetch product images and inspect them; use page text only for claims/copy. If only text exists, proceed only when the user accepts low product fidelity.
3. Create the main image first unless the user already has an approved main image.
4. Generate secondary/A+ modules from the approved main image and product references.
5. Run a blocking QA gate for product fidelity, unsupported claims, marketplace-safe composition, text legibility, Recolored logo, and Prompt-text override before presenting the set as finished.

Failure terms: **Recolored logo** means the product photo collapsed into a tinted graphic/logo-like mark instead of a photographed product. **Prompt-text override** means the output follows product words in the prompt instead of the attached reference. Reject both and retake with a scene-only, reference-led prompt.

## Compliance Guardrails

- Do not invent claims, certifications, medical benefits, endorsements, ratings, or comparative promises.
- Do not build product visuals from PDP copy alone when a reference image exists or can be fetched.
- Do not create fake badges, marketplace logos, or review-star systems unless the user supplied exact permitted assets.
- Call out that exact marketplace compliance still requires human/platform review.
- Keep module copy factual and user-supplied. If the user has no copy, generate visual modules without factual claims.

## Krea Pattern

Use `product-photo-hero.md` for the main image, `product-photo-lifestyle.md` for lifestyle/detail shots, and `../../krea-generate/workflows/image-text-poster.md` only when text-heavy infographics are required.
