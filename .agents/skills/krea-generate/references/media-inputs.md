# Media Inputs

How to pass reference images, start frames, and audio files to Krea models through MCP.

## Asset rule: upload before generation

Krea generation tools accept media references as **URLs**, but model input validators intentionally restrict which asset hosts can be used. Treat local files and arbitrary external URLs as source material, not as final model inputs. Before passing a media URL into fields such as `image_url`, `imageUrl`, `image_urls`, `imageUrls`, `reference_images`, `start_image`, `startImage`, `end_image`, `endImage`, `style_images[].url`, or `image_style_references[].url`, first make sure it is a Krea-hosted or explicitly approved asset URL.

If the URL is not already a Krea asset URL, download it to a local temp file, upload it with MCP `upload_asset`, then pass the returned Krea URL to the generation model. This is the skill-level fix for `Invalid asset URL` failures.

### Hosted URL from the user

When the user pasted an image/video/audio URL, do not pass it straight into generation unless it is already a Krea/approved asset host. Rehost it through Krea first:

1. Download the URL to a temporary local file.
2. Upload that file through Krea MCP.
3. Pass the returned Krea-hosted URL into the reference field declared by the selected model schema.

Use the field name accepted by the selected MCP model schema. Do not assume field casing; verify the connected tool schema before submitting.

### Local file (use upload)

When the user has a file on their machine:

1. Read the file with the agent's vision if visual understanding matters.
2. Upload the file through Krea MCP.
3. Use the returned Krea URL in the selected model's schema-confirmed media field.

**Important distinction:** `upload_asset` puts a file on Krea's servers so Krea models can use it as a reference. This is **not** the same as the agent reading an image. The agent reads images with its built-in vision (the `Read` tool on a local file path). Use both, for different jobs:

| What you need | How |
|---|---|
| The agent understands what's in the user's image | `Read` the local file (the agent's vision) |
| Krea uses the image as a generation reference | `upload_asset` -> pass the returned Krea URL into the model's input |

Often you do both: read the file first to know the brief better, then upload it to Krea so the model can use it.

## MCP upload pattern

Upload local files or downloaded external URLs once, resolve the Krea-hosted URL, then pass that URL using the field accepted by the selected model schema.

Do not guess field names. Inspect the live MCP model schema first; different models use different reference fields.

## Field-name crosswalk

The hosting rule applies regardless of naming convention. Always inspect the live schema, then put Krea-hosted URLs into whichever field it declares:

| Field family | Common shapes |
|---|---|
| Single image reference | `image_url`, `imageUrl`, or another schema-declared single URL field |
| Multiple image references | `image_urls`, `imageUrls`, `reference_images`, or another schema-declared array field |
| Video frame anchors | `start_image`, `startImage`, `end_image`, `endImage`, or schema-declared equivalents |
| Style/reference objects | `style_images[].url`, `image_style_references[].url`, or schema-declared equivalents |
| Audio/video references | Schema-specific URL fields such as `reference_audios`, `reference_videos`, or schema-declared equivalents |

## Which URLs can be passed directly?

Pass direct URLs only when they are already Krea-hosted or an explicitly approved Krea asset host. Otherwise, use the upload step above. Product pages, CDN images, GitHub raw images, S3 links you do not control, and ordinary `https://example.com/photo.jpg` references are not safe to pass directly into generation inputs; many models return HTTP 422 `Invalid asset URL`.

## Single image vs multiple images

Each model declares which input shape it accepts. Inspect the selected model schema through Krea MCP to confirm. Common shapes are:

- **`image_url` / `imageUrl`** (string, singular) - one reference.
- **`image_urls` / `imageUrls`** (array of strings) - multiple references.
- **`reference_images`** (array of strings) - common for video reference images.

## Reference image quality

Reference images that are too small (< 512px on the long side) often fail to anchor the generation well, even when the call succeeds. The model can fall back to a fresh text-to-image pass that ignores the reference. For best results:

- Use references ≥ 1024px on the long side
- For face injection, use clear front-facing photos at ≥ 1024px
- If you must use a smaller image, expect noisy results — and verify with vision before delivering

Example with multiple face references for a generated scene:

1. Upload each face photo through Krea MCP.
2. Select a live model whose schema supports multiple image references.
3. Pass the returned Krea URLs in the schema-confirmed multi-reference field.

## Video-specific media

Image-to-video models commonly accept:

- **`start_image` / `startImage`** - the first frame the video animates from
- **`end_image` / `endImage`** - an optional last frame
- **`audio` or reference-audio fields** - a reference audio track for lipsync or soundtrack matching, model-dependent

Inspect the selected model schema through Krea MCP to confirm exact field names; different models name these differently.

## Audio reference

For models that support an `audio` input (lipsync, music-driven motion):

1. Upload the audio file through Krea MCP.
2. Confirm the selected model's audio-reference field from its schema.
3. Pass the returned Krea URL in that schema-confirmed field.

Don't pass `generate_audio=true` or `generateAudio: true` to a model that takes a reference audio file - those are different mechanisms. Confirm with the schema.

## Common upload mistakes

- **Wrong mimeType.** `image/jpg` is invalid; use `image/jpeg`. For video, use `video/mp4`. For audio, `audio/mpeg` for mp3 and `audio/wav` for wav.
- **Passing a local path directly into `input.imageUrl`.** Krea doesn't fetch from the user's machine. Upload first, then use the returned URL.
- **Passing an arbitrary external URL directly into generation.** Download it, upload it to Krea, then use the Krea-hosted URL.
- **Forgetting `Read` on the user's attached file.** If you upload without looking at the content, you might miss what the user actually wants done.

## File size and format

Krea accepts standard formats:

- **Images:** `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/webp`
- **Video:** `video/mp4`, `video/quicktime`, `video/webm`
- **Audio:** `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/ogg`, `audio/mp4`

Files >50 MB may fail to upload — re-encode at lower bitrate first if needed.
