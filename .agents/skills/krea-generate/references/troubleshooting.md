# Troubleshooting

## MCP tool missing

```
ToolError: mcp__krea__... is not available
```

The Krea MCP server is not installed, not authenticated, or not exposed in the current session. Tell the user to connect or authenticate Krea MCP. For Codex plugin installs, tell them they can reauthenticate by uninstalling and reinstalling the Krea plugin so the install auth flow runs again. Do not use non-MCP fallbacks.

## Authentication

The MCP handles auth on the Krea side. If you see an explicit auth error from a tool call, the MCP server isn't properly configured. Surface it to the user - don't try to work around it. For Codex plugin installs, suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the Krea plugin to re-run authentication.

## Validation errors

- **`Missing required params: prompt`** - the model needs a prompt; ask the user.
- **`Invalid values: aspect_ratio=...`** - call `get_model_schema(model=<id>)` to see allowed values; pick one.
- **`Invalid asset URL`** - the input points at a non-Krea/non-approved host. This commonly appears on fields like `image_url` or `style_images.0.url`. Download the asset if needed, upload it with MCP `upload_asset`, then replace the field with the returned Krea-hosted URL.
- **`Unknown params: <name>`** - the schema doesn't accept that field. Don't guess what the right name is; run `get_model_schema` first.

## Job lifecycle errors

When polling `get_job(jobId=...)`:

- **`status: "failed"`** - server-side failure. The `result` field often has the reason. Common causes:
  - Content moderation (`nsfw`, `ip_detected`) - rephrase
  - Internal model error - retry once; if it fails again, switch model
  - Bad reference image (corrupted, unreadable) - re-upload
- **`status: "failed"` with `result: {}` and no error** - silent model failure. Retry once with a simpler prompt or fewer sequential actions; if it fails again, switch model or ask whether to swap the concept.
- **`status: "cancelled"`** - user or system aborted. Don't auto-retry.
- **`status: "queued"` for >5 minutes** - system capacity issue. Don't resubmit silently; ask the user whether to wait or cancel.

## Endpoint guesses

Do not inspect normal generation jobs by guessing API paths such as `https://api.krea.ai/v1/jobs/<id>`. Unsupported paths can return an HTML 404 page, not a JSON error, which breaks parsers and wastes time. Use MCP `get_job`.

## Cost / quota

- **HTTP 402 "Insufficient credits"** - top up at https://krea.ai/settings/billing.
- **HTTP 402 "Plan required"** - the model is on a higher tier. Surface the upgrade link without judgment.
- **HTTP 429 "Too many requests"** - concurrent job limit. Back off for 10-30s and retry. The MCP retries internally; the agent should not loop on this manually.

## Polling / network

- **Network error on `get_job`** - retry up to 3x with backoff (5s, 15s, 45s). If still failing, surface to user.
- **Timeout exceeded on sync call** - for video, this just means it's still rendering. Switch to async + poll (see `async-polling.md`).

## Quality issues

If you `Read` the output with vision and the result doesn't match the brief:

- **Reference was ignored** (asked for image-to-image, got generic text-to-image) - the reference may be too small; try >= 1024px on the long side.
- **Wrong subject** - prompt may be ambiguous. Refine with more specificity.
- **Missing details / generic** - the user probably wants a higher-fidelity model. Suggest one quietly: "want me to try with a higher-quality model?"
- **Garbled text** - model not strong at typography. Switch to an image archetype that explicitly handles text (see `model-catalog.md`).
- **Wrong style** - describe the style more concretely (medium, era, palette, reference).

Don't pretend a bad output is fine. Saying "here it is" when the result is clearly off is worse than saying "this didn't land - retry?"

## Local file issues

- **`upload_asset` fails with file too large** - files >50 MB often reject. Re-encode at lower bitrate / dimensions.
- **MIME type rejected** - use exact strings (`image/jpeg` not `image/jpg`; `audio/mpeg` not `audio/mp3`).
- **Base64 encoding wrong** - `fileData` must be the raw base64 string, no data-URL prefix unless the schema specifies. When in doubt, send just the base64 payload.

## Known issues / lessons captured 2026-05-17

These were uncovered during a production session that burned ~5,000 CU before producing acceptable video output. Each item is filed in the repository issue tracker or noted here so future agents do not repeat the failure path.

### MCP surface

| # | Symptom | Reality | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|
| #7 | Kontext / Seedream-4 reject generation inputs containing external URLs (`image_url`, `style_images.0.url`, etc.) | Asset validation intentionally expects Krea-hosted/approved assets | Download external URLs when needed, upload every local/non-Krea file through MCP first, then use the returned Krea-hosted URL |
| #9 | Long video generation exceeds sync wait limits | Sync generation waits cap at 300s | Submit async, then use MCP `get_job` polling |
| #11 | Video output is horizontal despite `aspect_ratio="9:16"` | A landscape `start_image` or landscape `reference_images[0]` can override aspect in Seedance-style models | Do not pass a landscape `start_image` for vertical social video; pad the storyboard to portrait or drop the landscape storyboard ref; see `../../krea-marketing/workflows/social-video-short.md` |
| - | `quality` is ignored or rejected by a specific model | The selected model may not support `quality` | Check the MCP model schema; use only fields present in the schema |
| - | Slow image models exceed the synchronous gateway window | The timeout response may not include a usable job id, even if the running job is billed | Prefer async when the model is slow; retry transient 502/524 with backoff |
| - | `gpt-image-2` rejects dimensions such as 1080x1350, or `aspect_ratio` alone | The model requires explicit `width`/`height` in multiples of 16 | Use ÷16 sizes: 1024x1280 (4:5), 1024x1024 (1:1), 1024x1360 (3:4), 1024x1824 (9:16) |

### Model behavior

| Model | Symptom | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| Seedance-style video models | Output is in slow motion | Strip `slow`, `gentle`, `soft`, and `slow motion`; use `smooth`, `steady`, `fluid`, or `natural realtime` |
| Seedance-style video models | 15s clips with many sequential actions fail or collapse | Compress to 5-8 visible beats, or use `../../krea-marketing/workflows/social-video-short.md` storyboard + timestamped timeline |
| Seedance-style video models | Subject identity drifts across cuts | Pass 2-3 varied face refs; for brand-critical likeness use `../workflows/lora-train-and-use.md` |
| Text-friendly image models | Storyboards with large technical fiches produce weak videos | Keep annotations editorial: tiny panel numbers, short action labels, side icons, header/footer |
| OpenAI-style image models | Portrait dimensions rejected | Use dimensions accepted by schema, often multiples of 16 such as `1024x1824` for 9:16 |
| GPT-image style models | **Recolored logo**: a real product reference is flattened into a graphic/logo-like mark and merely tinted | Reject the draft; retake with a cleaner photo reference, photo-first scene prompt, and vision QA before delivery |
| Nano Banana style models | **Prompt-text override**: output follows product words in the prompt instead of the attached product reference | Remove product color/material/garment descriptors from the prompt; describe only scene, pose, light, copy, camera, and placement |

### Workflow disasters to avoid

- Do not submit a video job without loading a `workflows/*.md` recipe first.
- Do not submit a short social video without showing the user an approved storyboard first.
- Do not generate per-panel images separately and ffmpeg-concatenate them for a social short; use one storyboard sheet and one timeline-driven video job.
- Do not silently poll for long-running jobs. Follow `progress-reporting.md`.
- Do not include slow-motion trigger words anywhere in Seedance-style prompts.
- Do not spend >100 CU without `cost-preflight.md`, unless the user has explicitly set a per-session override.

## Known issues / lessons captured 2026-05-19

These came from a campaign session where ambiguous "storyboard" vocabulary and skipped creative gates caused unnecessary campaign spend.

### Routing and creative gates

- **Ambiguous storyboard request**: in CPG/FMCG/agency contexts, "storyboard" may mean a campaign key-visual sheet, not film pre-vis. Ask for a layout reference and route to `../../krea-marketing/workflows/key-visual-sheet.md`.
- **Boring output after fidelity success**: changing only the scene/content often misses the note. Identify whether the user wants format, content, palette, voice, or fidelity changed before regenerating.
- **"Surprise me"**: permission to take taste risks, not permission to skip storyboard/key-visual approval gates.

### Model behavior

| Model | Symptom | Workaround |
|---|---|---|
| Seedance-2 style video models | Macro prompts with tiny flying subjects such as butterflies, bees, or hummingbirds can fail repeatedly with empty result payloads | Retry once; if it fails again, swap to non-animal motion such as petals, leaves, bubbles, condensation, or light rays, or switch model |
| Seedance-2 style video models | Hand placing product into frame can fail or look awkward | Start with the product already placed; animate environment, light, condensation, or camera motion |
| Seedance-2 / videoV2 | **Shadow-fail**: job returns `status:"completed"` with `result:{}` (no `urls[]`). No error message. | Silent content-filter refusal — not a render failure. Detect by checking `result.urls` presence, not status. Retry with sanitized prompt: drop proper nouns, drop role descriptors (`salaryman` → `man`), drop IP-suggestive phrases, drop specific signage text. Keep `start_image` — image carries identity. If still empty, drop `end_image` and retry start-image-only. See `models/seedance-2.md` "Content-filter shadow-fail". |
| Seedance-2 / videoV2 | `status:"failed"` with empty result and NO error message in payload | Hard-fail (distinct from shadow-fail) — usually caused by `end_image` being too visually divergent from `start_image`. Seedance can't interpolate the transition within the clip duration. Per `models/seedance-2.md` "end_image = visual destination": keep end_image within ~2-3s of story-time from start_image. Workaround: drop `end_image` entirely and retry start-image-only. |
| Seedance-2 / videoV2 | HTTP 429 `CONCURRENCY_LIMIT_REACHED` on the 13th+ parallel job | Hard cap is 12 concurrent videoV2 jobs per workspace. Throttle parallel submission to batches of ≤12; poll until in-flight count drops, submit next batch. See `models/seedance-2.md` "Concurrency cap". |
| Seedance-2 / videoV2 | Schema error on `duration` < 4 | Seedance-2 minimum duration is 4s. For shot-grammar runs (2-3s cuts), submit at 4s and ffmpeg-trim to spec at the assembly step. |
| Seedance-2 / videoV2 | `status:"failed"` with an explicit `error.code:"content_policy"` and message "An external provider's moderation systems rejected the generation" | Distinct from shadow-fail and hard-fail: this is a real error payload, not a silent/empty one, and can fire on a compliant still that already passed vision QA. Observed on dark/moody single-source-rim-light framing with an orbiting camera. Retry once with simplified, brighter wording (drop "dark", moody lighting descriptors, and atmospheric haze/dust language); if it fails twice, swap to a brighter treatment rather than retrying indefinitely — this can be provider-side flakiness, not a real policy violation. |
| ffmpeg | `drawtext=` / `subtitles=` filter not found / `No such filter` | Stock Homebrew `ffmpeg` 8.x ships without libfreetype/libass. Verified fix: `brew install ffmpeg-full` (keg-only) and call its binary directly at `/opt/homebrew/opt/ffmpeg-full/bin/ffmpeg` — it includes `drawtext` and `subtitles`. Simpler than a PNG-overlay fallback when available. If `ffmpeg-full` can't be installed, fall back to a PNG-overlay approach; reference at `runs/anime-v2/logs/make_subs.py`. |
| ffmpeg | `ffmpeg -sseof -0.1 -i shot.mp4 -frames:v 1 last.png` returns "Output file is empty" | Use the working pattern: `ffmpeg -sseof -1 -i shot.mp4 -update 1 -frames:v 1 -q:v 2 last.png`. The `-update 1` flag is required for single-frame extraction. |
| Some image models | Image model returns 1024x1024 square despite `aspect_ratio: "16:9"` | `google/imagen-4-ultra` and `google/nano-banana-pro` may ignore aspect-only inputs. Pass explicit schema-supported width and height when available. |
| GPT-image style models | Large simultaneous image batches can hit account concurrency limits, especially after orphaned timeout jobs | Submit campaign sheets or drafts in waves of 8 or fewer and retry 429s with 20s backoff |

### Kling 3.0 — model id and required fields

- The user-facing name `kling-video-v3.0-pro` resolves to model id `kling/kling-3.0` with `mode=pro`. There is no separate `-pro` model id in the catalog. Always use MCP `list_models` and inspect matching Kling entries to confirm.
- Required fields per schema: `prompt`, `aspect_ratio` (enum `16:9` or `9:16`), `duration` (3-15), `generate_audio` (bool), `mode` (`std` / `pro` / `4k`). Use MCP schema-declared fields only.
- Schema has no `reference_images` field. Identity continuity for chained narrative work rides entirely on the still-compose pass and the `end_image` hook.

### Krea 2 (`krea/krea-2/*`) MCP notes

For MCP use, rely on the connected tool schema rather than public endpoint details:

- Krea 2 moodboard generation uses `moodboards: [{id, strength}]` in the observed public-API schema, with observed `maxItems: 1`. For moodboard discovery and K2-specific rules, load `models/krea-2.md`.
- MCP may expose `aspect_ratio`, `aspectRatio`, or another schema-declared field shape. Inspect the tool schema before submitting.
- Response job id fields are schema-dependent. Use the id returned by the MCP call when polling with `get_job`.

This is consistent with `media-inputs.md`: inspect MCP schemas instead of guessing field names.
